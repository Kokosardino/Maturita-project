# Maturita-project
To finish manadatory course of study, students in Czechia must pass final exam called "Maturita".

At [GJJ](https://www.gjj.cz/) the final exam takes form of a project of a larger scale with a vaguely specified thematics. The theme I selected was "Machine Learning", which I, not knowing much about the machine learning at the time, further specified to developing a neural network, that will be able to correctly classify the MNIST dataset. 

This repository serves to archive only the application developed to pass the exam, not the associated text.
